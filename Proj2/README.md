GameObject/Component
Component/Monobehavior - every script is a component

.gameObject/GetComponent() - Accessing gameobject through component, accessing component through gameobject
Accessing component variables through scripting - GetComponent<>().useGravity, etc.

Start()/Update() - get game loop

Exposing variables to the inspector - variables don't save in play mode, inspector values override default values in script
Accessing variables from different scripts - back to every script is a component

Vector3? Time.deltaTime?
